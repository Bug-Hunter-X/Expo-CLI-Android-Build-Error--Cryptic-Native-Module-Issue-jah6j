# Expo CLI Android Build Error: Cryptic Native Module Issue

This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-diagnose error encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The error message is typically vague, pointing to issues with native module processing and resource handling without providing concrete details. This often makes debugging challenging.

## Problem

The issue centers around the Android build system failing during the resource processing phase. This may manifest as an error like "Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'", along with a potentially lengthy stack trace that doesn't clearly identify the root cause.  The problem stems from discrepancies or issues within the native Android components of the app, commonly involving third-party libraries or incorrect configurations.

## Solution

The solution usually involves carefully checking native module configurations, dependencies, and any custom Android configurations within your Expo project. This may require examining the AndroidManifest.xml file for discrepancies or troubleshooting any issues with the native modules' integration with Expo.

This repository provides example code that reproduces a simplified version of the error (bug.js) and a solution (bugSolution.js) illustrating the techniques needed to resolve such issues.
