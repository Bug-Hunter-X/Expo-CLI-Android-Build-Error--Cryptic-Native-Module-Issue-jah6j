This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The error message is cryptic and unhelpful, often involving issues with the Android build system and native modules.  The exact error message can vary but usually includes something like "Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'.".  It's often related to missing or incorrectly configured native dependencies, particularly if you are using third-party libraries that have native components.
